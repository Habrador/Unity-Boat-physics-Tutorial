# Unity Boat physics Tutorial

Learn how to make a realistic boat in Unity with the physics equations used by actual boats. The main inspiration comes from this article:

* [Water interaction model for boats in video games](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/water-interaction-model-for-boats-in-video-games)


YouTube video showing the result:

Notice that the code here hasn't exactly the same code structure as in the tutorial. I'm still not happy with the water surface and will update with a better version in the future. 


## FAQ

* **Why is my boat launching into the sky when it hits the water?** The most likely solution to this problem is that the collider attached to the boat has to be set to convex! This by the way always true when you attach a collider to a rigibody.
