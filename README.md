Notice that the code here hasn't exactly the same code structure as in the tutorial. I'm still not happy with the water surface and will update with a better version in the future. 


## FAQ

* **Why is my boat launching into the sky when it hits the water?** The most likely solution to this problem is that the collider attached to the boat has to be set to convex! This by the way always true when you attach a collider to a rigibody.
